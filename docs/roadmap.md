# Media Lock Roadmap

Each phase ends only when its exit criteria are met. Later phases must not conceal a failed Phase 0 assumption.

## Phase 0 — Technical validation

Build a Console Prototype that enumerates GSMTC Sessions, observes changes, chooses one Session and routes supported
commands. Evaluate candidate physical-media-key backends on real hardware and prove capture, consumption and routing
without duplicate Windows behavior.

Exit criteria:

- Session enumeration and event refresh work for Brave/YouTube Music and at least one second named, independent
  GSMTC source; the evidence records the exact application and version. Spotify Desktop remains part of the MVP
  compatibility matrix, but is not a unique Phase 0 feasibility gate.
- Manual command dispatch targets the selected Session.
- At least one input backend has documented support boundaries and repeatable evidence for consume behavior.
- Ordinary-user privilege behavior is known.
- Suspend/resume and Session recreation limitations are recorded.
- Any failed foundational assumption updates product scope before Phase 1.

## Phase 1 — Core

Implement immutable Session snapshots, Media Command, Session Fingerprint, Routing Mode, Route Decision, router
state transitions, Recovery and Fallback Policy behind platform-independent interfaces.

Exit criteria:

- State transitions and route decisions have deterministic unit tests.
- Concurrent event ordering is serialized and cancellation behavior is tested.
- Settings/state schemas and failure handling are defined.
- Core has no WPF, WinRT or Win32 dependency.

## Phase 2 — WPF shell

Implement the main WPF experience with MVVM: current target, Session list, manual media controls, lock/unlock and
Windows Auto. Keep ViewModels limited to presentation state and commands.

Exit criteria:

- Critical UI flows work through application services.
- No GSMTC or input interception logic lives in Views or ViewModels.
- Accessibility names, keyboard navigation and empty/error states are covered.

## Phase 3 — Tray, settings and lifecycle

Add system tray behavior, close-to-tray, explicit exit, JSON persistence, structured logging, single-instance,
login startup and settings UI.

Exit criteria:

- Startup and shutdown ordering is repeatable without orphaned subscriptions.
- Corrupt settings produce actionable recovery and preserve recoverable data.
- Tray state reflects Windows Auto, Locked and Recovering.
- Startup integration is reversible and does not require elevation.

Implementation note: Phase 3 persists runtime state for later recovery. Phase 4 consumes that state only when the
configured default is Session Lock and the persisted target has one unambiguous acceptable successor.

## Phase 4 — Recovery hardening

Implement Session loss detection, matching, configurable timeout/fallback, crash recovery and suspend/resume
reacquisition.

Implementation note: suspend releases the old manager and subscriptions. Resume publishes Reacquiring, makes at
most three bounded acquisition attempts, and remains observably Unavailable if all attempts fail; a later resume
can retry without restarting the catalog stream.

Exit criteria:

- Browser refresh/restart and application exit/restart scenarios pass the supported test matrix.
- Ambiguous candidates do not silently bind to an unsafe target.
- Every Recovery outcome is observable in UI and logs.

## Phase 5 — Rules and post-MVP features

Add App Lock and priority rules after Session Lock is reliable. Then evaluate artwork, seek, volume, custom hotkeys
and optional browser integration as separately scoped work.

Implementation note: App Lock is delivered before Priority Rules. It persists source application identity, reuses
one deterministic candidate policy for interactive and startup resolution, and remains distinct from Session Lock.
Priority Rules and every optional media/browser feature use later independent branches.

Exit criteria:

- Rule ordering and conflicts have deterministic behavior.
- Browser integration is optional and cannot weaken GSMTC-only operation.
- Version scope is reflected in product and testing documentation.

## Release candidate

Produce a `win-x64` self-contained single-file candidate only after the MVP success criteria pass. Validate it on a
clean supported Windows environment before describing the package as portable.
